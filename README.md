# AppliedComputationalThinking
My school homework from #DescomplicaDigital on Applied Computational Thinking begins with an introduction to Python, a versatile language that enables clear, logical problem-solving. Students learn to use variables and data types to store information, flow control structures to guide program behavior, and collections to organize groups of data. Functions allow code reuse, while string manipulation supports handling textual content. Reading and writing files teaches data persistence, and exception handling ensures programs can manage errors gracefully. Learners also explore manipulating different file types such as CSV and JSON, and apply Object-Oriented Programming to create modular, scalable systems. As skills advance, they build an initial project and prepare its structure, leading to the development of an API connected to a database. This API is gradually improved with better design and validation, expanded with new features such as update and delete operations, and ultimately enhanced with additional capabilities tailored to evolving project needs.
